## Auto-Formatting Rule

### Code Formatting Automation
- **Automatic Formatting**: Always run `npm run format` at the end of any coding task
- **Pre-commit**: Ensure all code changes are properly formatted before completing tasks
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent code style across the entire codebase

### Implementation
- After making any code changes, automatically execute `npm run format`
- This runs Prettier with the project's configuration to format all files
- The format script uses: `prettier --write .`
- Respects `.prettierignore` file for excluded paths

### When to Apply
- After creating new files
- After modifying existing code
- After completing any development task
- Before suggesting the task is complete

### Benefits
- Ensures consistent code style
- Reduces code review friction
- Maintains project formatting standards
- Improves code readability

### Note
This rule works in conjunction with the existing Prettier configuration in `.prettierrc` and respects the ignore patterns in `.prettierignore`.
