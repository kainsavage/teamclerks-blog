Well... here we are again. Last time, I wrote a bit about beating the game and entering the debate 
over the challenge that some gamers were experiencing. I had a heading "Review" midway through that
post and I realize that a) I hadn't gotten the true ending yet and b) I didn't really review the
game. My son and I got to 100% some time ago (probably, before the new year), and I have replayed
Silksong a few times and now believe I have proper scope to give my review. To do so, I am going to
break my review into a sectioned rubric.

Again, spoiler warning ahead! I will be covering aspects of the game that necessitate some spoilers.
If you want to experience the game unspoiled, and I recommend everyone do, then bookmark and come
back later to see if you agree with me.

### Challenge

Right off the bat, I'm picking up where I left my last post. Silksong is a hard game. Rather, 
Silksong is as close to a FromSoft game as you can get from a Metroidvania. The gameplay starts off
rather linear, as is typical of Metroidvanias, and forces you to traverse the world in a specific
way. This helps the gamer learn what to do as well as what not to do. However, there is a point when the 
training wheels fall off (read: _not_ taken off) and the gamer is left to their own devices.

Hornet starts in Moss Grotto; you wind back and forth working your way up the only navigable path
until you find your first bench - the bonfire of the Silksong world. Here, you regenerate your
health, you fill in your map (if you have one and the quill item), and this is your checkpoint
should you die moving forward. Assuming the gamer has played Hollowknight, there is nothing to learn
yet; this is the same experience. However, this tells the gamer something - danger ahead.

Leaving the bench and continuing the only path to progress, you enter a boss fight with the Moss
Mother—a straightforward exercise of swoops and crowd control that a seasoned Hollowknight player
will find fun but mundane. ![Skarrgard](/images/silksong/B_Moss_Mother.png) Most gamers, myself
included, will not notice what Team Cherry are
doing here: they are subverting your expectations on the difficulty of the game. They know that the
massive hype around the game will garner gamers unfamiliar with the franchise to pick up a copy and
give it a whirl. They know that the first two hours of a game are in that refund window and they
cannot spike the difficulty just yet, though difficult boss fights and platforming are their
signature game design. Right now, Hornet has a dialogue with the first NPC, the Chapel Maid, and is
given the game's first quest which is to reach the height of Pharloom and confront the powers which
brought her here, and again the path of progression is a single direction; you keep marching to the 
right until Hornet reaches Bone Bottom, the first town in Pharloom.

The gamer may have collected some of the game's currency, Rosaries, to this point and a vendor will
gladly sell you a few things to help you on the journey, but - and I'll give this a proper review
in a bit - the gamer usually does not have enough to buy anything _yet_. So, Hornet talks to 
everyone in town and eventually finds she must continue traveling to the right to progress. Hornet
winds through The Marrow, the first area where platforming and combat are exercised in earnest,
and finds a lava pit that simply bars her from continuing to the right, and so, she climbs until 
she finds her way to Mosshome to acquire her first ability - the Silkspear.

Silkspear in hand, she continues on the path until she comes across the Bell Beast, the first 
_real_ boss in the game, and after coming out on top she wins the right to fast-travel via that 
same Bell Beast, and continuing on the path of progression she rings the first major bell in the 
game. You see, Hornet is expected to ring five of these grand bells in order to reach the summit 
of Pharloom. The quest log deliberately tells the player that this is what they are intended to do.
It's the only real guiding light at this point in the game. However, ringing this bell opens a new
path back through The Marrow to the other side of that uncrossable lava pit, and eventually two
branches become available: Hunter's March and the Deep Docks.

Hunter's March has an immediate *big* enemy: the Skarrgard. This enemy bars continuation into 
Hunter's March until he is defeated and is the 
[Tree Sentinel](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel) of Silksong. 
![Skarrgard](/images/silksong/B_Skarrgard.png#right) The player has, hopefully, found the nearby 
bench and acquired their first red tool - the 
[Straight Pin](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Straight_Pin) - and might be happy to bang their head
against the Skarrgard. However, this is Team Cherry teaching the player a useful skill: sometimes
you will come across a boss in Silksong that is intended for later when you have more health or
tools or skills, and more importantly: the gamer can just go do something else. This is the first 
point in Silksong where Team Cherry deliberately teach the gamer that they have a choice. They 
_can_ beat their head on the Skarrgard and progress through the Hunter's March. They _can_ go the
other way and end up in Deep Docks which is much easier than the Skarrgard. But the gamer gets to
choose.

From here, there are several points in the game where the progression path branches, and the gamer
has myriad choices for where to go and what to do next. They will inevitably find themselves in a
boss room with something they are not prepared to defeat, and inevitably given that option to look
elsewhere. A number of upgrades (the Needle, Masks, Spools) are not sealed behind bosses in 
Silksong. Rather, Team Cherry _wants_ the gamer to explore and find upgrades to make bosses more
manageable. A lot of the complaints I witnessed over Silksong boil down to the people who refused
to leave the Skarrgard undefeated, and found that experience unenjoyable. In my opinion, if you
decide that the Skarrgard is the hill you will die on, then you have no one to blame but yourself.
The game _tried_ to coax you toward the Dash ability in Deep Docks, which would make that fight
much more enjoyable and straightforward. Team Cherry _tried_ to make you understand early on that
you do not _have_ to fight this boss, and that theme might continue into the later parts of 
Silksong...

### Currency

Currency is the, pardon the pun, other side of the coin regarding challenge. One of the aspects
that makes Souls-likes challenging is that the currency is dropped upon death and the player has
to, some through much peril, return to that same spot to reclaim their hard-earned cash. 
However, in Souls-likes you generally use the currency to level up your character as well as
buying items throughout the world, but in Silksong the only use for Rosaries is in the shops
where you buy new tools, masks, spool shards, tools, etc. The _other_ thing you spend Rosaries
on is benches. Yes, the save points... have to be bought by and large. The area that gets the
most written about its brutality is the upper bench in Blasted Steps.

![Skarrgard](/images/silksong/Screenshot_SS_BlastedSteps_02.png)

*Getting* to this bench is an absolute slog on first play-through. Tons of platforming, enemies
popping up at the worst possible times, projectiles that ricochet chaotically... *many* gamers
get through that grind to get to the top only to have lost their Rosaries along the way and find
a toll bench as the worst pain imagineable. And, hey, I am sympathetic to that. I get it. It isn't
fun or compelling gameplay _when that happens_... but this is in the Souls-like genre: you knew
what you were signing up for from the beginning.

Having played through a few times doing challenge runs, I noticed it less and less; the better you
get at the navigation and fights the less you end up needed to spend your money on benches. If you
end up dying in a boss arena, you always have time to collect when you get back, so bossrooms end
up being banks for your Rosaries until you overcome the fight. The only real time your Rosaries
are in danger is during platforming deep in an area. Going back to the Blasted Steps, when the 
gamer does make it to the top they usually can do it again and again over and over if needed. They
just needed to learn the layout and pitfalls, so those players who got to the bench without any
money ended up forging ahead, but when they died would be back in an area where they can farm some
cash to bring back to the top.

Aside from the benches, the economy of Pharloom is surprisingly deep. There are roughly ten vendors
all selling things to help with the journey, and they are all pretty well spaced out in terms of
where you should be when you have Rosaries. It is a very nice improvement from Hollowknight wherein
the player might run out of things to buy in the early middle-game. Team Cherry even implemented a
fountain into which the player must deposit 3,000 geo to earn a charm; they knew the player would
run out of a use for their currency eventually, and when the currency has no value it's worthless.
In Pharloom, these vendors have tons to sell Hornet well into the beginning of the late game, when
the gamer would expect to naturally run out of stuff to buy. However, Team Cherry has another trick
up their collective sleave in that there is a secondary currency which only matters when grinding
bosses: Shell Shards.

Throughout the game, killing normal enemies usually produces some Rosaries and a few Shell Shards;
the latter being used to construct tools for Hornet to use, mainly in boss rooms. Shell Shards are
the genius Rosary sink for the end-game when all the items have been bought and Rosaries would,
like Geo in Hollowknight, start piling up. When the game begins grinding a hard boss, those Shell
Shards get used up. A gamer with full toolpouch upgrades might be able to grind a boss for an hour
using their tools every attempt, but then they have another choice: continue grinding without tools
or accept that it's time to take a break and restock.

I think this dual currency system is great! It teaches the gamer that using tools is good generally,
but also that experimentation with other tools is also good. As the gamer progresses through the
game they will naturally collect both currencies and want to spend the Rosaries in making Hornet
stronger while they naturally build Shell Shards to use tools generally. It's only at the end-game
when Rosaries are no longer meaningful that the player usually converts them to Shell Shards, and
every vendor NPC sells them so it doesn't matter where the particular boss is as the trek is short
to restock.

### The World of Pharloom

As I mentioned before, we are given control of Hornet in the Moss Grotto which is wholly lacking in
oppression; rather, the gamer will feel bright and bouncy with warm inviting colors and playful
simple opponents. It's the tutorial area, but it's also setting the tone of the game differently
than it plays out. As we travel higher into Pharloom with Hornet, we start seeing the world for 
what it truly is: dead or dying. Each area of the world has function to the lore in the story and
serves those functions well. For instance, The Marrow feels cold and dark and the surrounding
creatures are all of the "mindless bug" variant from Hollowknight, meaning that they have few or 
no Rosaries, speak no words, and attack on sight. The Deep Docks feels like an industrial zone
where ironwork and smelting occurs; maybe, using natural resources from The Marrow.

Each zone has a uniqueness to it that goes beyond palette-swaps or decore. The Wormways feels
claustrophobic and skittery; it reminded me a somewhat brighter, albeit earthier, Deepnest. I think
this is what stands out for me when compared to the original Hollowknight: aside from Pharloom 
being *SO* much more vast, it makes the point that each area has its own aesthetic that is distinct
while feeling tightly wound together in the world. Like I said before, maybe The Marrow looks and
feels like it does because the Deep Docks uses those resources. The Far Fields have warring tribes
of ants which seep into the surrounding areas such as Greymore, which sits directly on top of the 
Hunter's March where most of the ants are seen in the early and late game.

Another thing that stuck out to me is that there are still bugs (I wanted to write 'people') in
Pharloom who live actually live there. In Hollowknight, you visit Dirtmouth initially with its sole
inhabitant (initially) and venture down into Hollownest to find more places where bugs live, but
almost everywhere feels intentionally empty because the infection has taken over so many minds. The
vendor Sly is found in what I would call a town, though it is just a few decrepit shacks housing
three bugs, but otherwise the world feels mindless and empty. By contrast, in Pharloom there are
several NPCs in various houses and they actually live there with purpose. Pebb is in Bone Bottom
temporarily to sell his wares as he makes the climb to the Citadel, but Mort is keep to live his
days out in his home/store in Far Fields while Creige runs his bar in Greymore.

In one sense, I see a lot of Hollowknight in Silksong: both games have an antagonist bent on
domination of the bugs beneath them. The Radiance used some hitherto unknown means of bending the
minds of the infected to its whims, while Grand Mother Silk uses her silk to control the bugs of
Pharloom directly. The lore folk will probably read me the riot act, but to me it seems like the
bugs of Pharloom _give in_ to being controlled by the silk in order to live longer, better, lives.
And in so doing, the reason an enemy attacks you becomes clear while the reason why those vendors
don't might be because they are somewhat protected by distance, their housing, and/or their sheer
will.

I don't see it talked about much, but when Hornet first arrives in Pharloom she has a couple of
cutscenes where the darkness is pounding in on her and her movement is hindered to a limp. At one
point directly out of the tutorial area it gets so bad as to overwhelm her and she passes out. A
theory of mine is that Grand Mother Silk was attempting to control Hornet with her silk like she
does the common bugs of Pharloom, but Hornet's will is simply too strong. Arguably, this should
continue ever stronger the closer we get to the Citadel and Grand Mother Silk, but maybe she
realized after the earlier attempts that it simply wouldn't work.

The world-building hangs its hat on environmental storytelling. We see these threads popping up
and springing the controlled bugs to life. We see
