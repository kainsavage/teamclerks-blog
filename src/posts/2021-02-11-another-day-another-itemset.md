# Continued HK Item Randomizer

As I said yesterday, I woke up at the toll bench in City of Tears, and went down to collect my
third nail upgrade before setting out to collect more items. At this point, the world is wide 
open to me and I just need to decide what is the best use of my time. So, I decide to hit up the
Ancient Basin. In recent runs, basin has been very good item-wise - the pale ore was a relic, the
fountain was Grubberfly's, the King's Idol under the Mawlurks, however, was Monarch Wings (almost
perfect placement given the next item would have been the Monarch Wings item, which was another 
relic).

From here, the world is completely opened to me except for shade dash areas (which there are only
like three or four of note). I decide to head into Deepnest since I have the Tram Pass and it is
a quick hop from Ancient Basin. The Vessel was a Vessel, Nosk's Pale Ore was a relic, the Tram Pass
item was the Distant Village stag, which was really nice since that is basically a short-cut.

I head into the Distant Village even though I do not have the Dreamnail, yet. My thinking was that
I could gather the relic and clear my way to the bench, and when I get Dreamnail later, I could 
just bench-warp back. From here, I head out to get into the Weaver's Den, where I collect a relic 
and a charm notch.

At this point in HKIR runs, I have exhausted a *lot* of what I can do to get a *bunch* of items.
I decided that the last true "get a bunch of items" run was Kingdon's Edge. First, I collect the
relic item directly up the wall, then head over to do Hornet2. From there, I drop down to do the
Nail Master and to pick up Quickslash's item. Then, I bench-warp back to the camp and head up for
the coliseum and the Pale Lurker (there are two King's Idol item pickups; one on the way and one 
at Pale Lurker). All tolled, I pick up more non-progression items, but still have yet to find my
third dreamer or the Dreamnail. Again, I am running out of runs that collect lots of items.

Since I picked up the Monarch Wings, I bench-warp back to Crystal Guardian and do his second fight.
Finally, I get the Dreamnail. Next I head over and clear my way to the Queen's Gardens stag 
station. Not much to speak of item-wise, but I am collecting a lot of charms/notches/masks/vessels
at this point.

Lastly, I do a bunch of bench-warps all over to collect stuff I had to leave behind because I was
missing a progression item - Bretta (and her item back in Dirtmouth), the dreamers I had to leave
behind, and finally did Uumuu and collected that item.
