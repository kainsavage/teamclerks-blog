## Who are you?

[kain](https://bsky.app/profile/teamclerks.net)

I am a software engineer of {(new Date().getFullYear() - 2006).toString()} years who enjoys writing from time to time. I love playing
with new technologies and learning new things. I am a big fan of open source software and I try to
contribute to it when I can. Every couple of years I end up trying out a technology that is new to
me by rewriting my personal blog. This time I am using SvelteKit and giving it a try. So far, I am very happy
with how it is working out. The development experience is smooth and the deployment process is straightforward.

## What do you write about?

I write about whatever I feel like writing about. I have written about software development, video
games, Dodger baseball, politics, and more. I have a lot of interests and I like to write about any
of them when I feel like it. I am not trying to make money off of this blog, so I do not feel
obligated to write about anything in particular.

In fact, I am exploring BlueSky (pronounced: `/bluːskiː/`) as a mechanism for writing and
sharing. It feels like a good fit for getting my writing out there, and gives me a short-form way
to share my thoughts and ideas, and link back to more long-form content here. Interestingly,
BlueSky is a social media platform with a more self-identifying form of verification. That is, I
state that I am `kain@teamclerks.net` on their platform and they ask me to set some DNS records
to prove that assertion. I think that is a pretty cool way to do it.
