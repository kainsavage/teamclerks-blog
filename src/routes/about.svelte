<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    TeamClerks is an entity I founded around 2001. Originally, it was a
    gaming clan amongst my close friends. Eventually, it grew into a
    side-business (I built and sold custom gaming computers for a while
    during college).
</p>

<p>I am unsure what TeamClerks is today.</p>

<p>
    Currently, I am treating it as my personal development sandbox to try
    out new technologies and implement ideas I have. This site, for
    instance, is a blog I built using React as the front-end because I
    wanted to try it out.
